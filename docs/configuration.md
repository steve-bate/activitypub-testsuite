# Test Configuration

[Table of Contents](toc.md)

The test configurations are stored in a TOML file with sections for the server and for individual tests.

## Server-related Configuration

### Server Capabilities

The server capabilities can be used to skip tests automatically if the specified capabilities are not declared. The capabilities are represented as a period-separated identifier where each level of the identifier can have a value defined for it. For example, `a.b.c` could have entries for `a`, `a.b` and `a.b.c`. The default for a level can be set by using the level name with a `.default` suffix. Setting `a.b.default=false`, would set the default for all levels under `a.b` to be false.

## Test Configuration

Depending on the test, there may be test-specific configuration available. For example, in many cases the ActivityPub specification is a bit vague about what HTTP status codes should be used in certain cases and even where a code is suggested, it's not a requirement. It might be an error code or even a success code (for a failure) if the implementer thinks that's good for some reason (security or privacy, for example). The test default may expect a status code based on the specification suggestions or common sense, but it's possible to override these on a per-test basis since there is so much room for developer-specific interpretation in these cases.

The per-test configuration is also stored in the `config.toml` file in a section named after the test. For example:

```toml
[test_nonowner_outbox_post_disallowed]
# Server wants to hide the failure code
status_code = 201
```

If a test is known to fail, then the test runner can be told to skip the test and optionally mark it as a bug. For example:

```toml
[test_outbox_partial_update]
skip = "Only merges. Does not remove properties."
bug = true
```

The `skip` value can be a description or just `true`. The description and the `bug` indicator will be used in test report generation (future).

For parameterized tests, the section will be the `[test_name.parameterized-key]`. This is similar to the `pytest` naming but they put the `parameterize-key` in square brackets. That is awkward with TOML so the square brackets are replaced with a leading period. This also has the advantage of being hierarchical so you can define a test configuration value for all the instances of the parameterized test by just specifying the test name.
