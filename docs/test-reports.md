# Generating Test Reports

[Table of Contents](toc.md)

Running...

`aptest report`

will use the `test-report.json` generated by `pytest` to create an HTML report. By default, it will generate the report to the console which can be redirected to a file or piped to another program (to generate a PDF, for example).

You can use the `--browser` option to display the report in a browser. If no output file is specified, it will generate the report to a file called `test-report.html`.

The report includes the test outcomes, test documentation, test parameters (if any), required capabilities for the test and more.
