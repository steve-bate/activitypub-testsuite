# AP Section 6.1 - The Update activity is used when updating an already
# existing object. The side effect of this is that the object MUST
# be modified to reflect the new structure as defined in the update activity,
# assuming the actor has permission to update this object.

# AP Section 6.3.1 Partial Updates. For client to server interactions, updates are
# partial; rather than updating the document all at once, any key value pair supplied
# is used to replace the existing value with the new value. This only applies to the
# top-level fields of the updated object. A special exception is for when the value
# is the json null type; this means that this field should be removed from the
# server's representation of the object.

# AP Section 7.3 Update Activity - For server to server interactions,
# an Update activity means that the receiving server SHOULD
# update its copy of the object of the same id to the
# copy supplied in the Update activity. Unlike the
# client to server handling of the Update activity,
# this is not a partial update but a complete replacement of the object.

# The receiving server MUST take care to be sure that the Update
# is authorized to modify its object. At minimum, this may
# be done by ensuring that the Update and its object are of same origin.
